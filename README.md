# My very first webpage

Welcome!

This is my first README file. I'm competing a course as a full stack web developer.

I'm understanding and using the fundamentals of HTML5, CSS3 java script and so much more.

Some of the tools I'm using are cloud9 and git hub.

By the end I'll be able to create magical websites.
